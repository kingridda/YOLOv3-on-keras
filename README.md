# YOLOv3 on keras

Model build based on the original pre-trained YOLO model. Assets are stored on a public drive.

## Usage

Upload the notebook to Colab and run all (notebook should work directly with no changes)

Optional: tune threshlods (confidence, IoU,...) as you like, change images or test on your own images.
